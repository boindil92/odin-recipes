        <h2>Now comes the question: what is a Churro?</h2>

        <p>A <em>"Churro"</em> is a type of fried dough from <strong>Spanish and Portuguese</strong> cuisine,</p>
        <p>made with <strong>choux pastry dough</strong> piped into hot oil with a piping </p>
        <p>bag and large closed star tip or similar shape.</p>

        <h2>The matter of churros <em>"where it all begins"</em></h2>
        <p><strong>(aka the ingredients)</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>½ cup margarine</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The <em>"to do list"</em></h2>
        <p><strong>(to the well organized minds: Churros.exe)</strong></p>

        <ol>
            <li>
               <p> In a heavy deep skillet or deep-fryer, heat oil to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C). </p>
               <p> Should be about 1 1/2 inches deep.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In a medium saucepan, heat water and margarine to a rolling boil. Combine the flour and salt;</p>
                <p>Stir into the boiling mixture. Reduce heat to low and stir vigorously until the mixture forms a ball, about 1 minute.</p>
                <p>Remove from heat and beat in the eggs one at a time.</p>
                <p>Spoon the mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Carefully squeeze out 4 inch long strips of dough directly into the hot oil.</p>
                <p>Fry 3 or 4 strips at once, until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side.</p>
                <p>Remove from hot oil to drain on paper towels.</p>
                <p>Stir together the sugar and cinnamon; roll churros in the mixture while still hot.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
